Story Feature Implementation

This project implements a simple "Story" feature, similar to Instagram or WhatsApp, where users can upload short, temporary content that disappears after 24 hours. Users can add a story by clicking a "Plus" button, which allows them to upload an image. The image is converted to a Base64 string and saved in the browser's local storage, where it remains accessible for 24 hours before being automatically removed.
